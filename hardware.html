    <div id="mymom"> <p1  style="font-family:verdana" ""><em><strong>Now I will show the hardware and what they do!</strong></em></p1></div>
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Motherboard</h2>
    <p1 style="font-family:verdana"><strong>The motherboard, what is a motherboard? The motherboard is circuit board that contains multiple components of a computer or other devices that has connectors for other devices or circuit boards that can be slotted in. The motherboard is the reason why computers work and the other circuit boards are able to communicate to make the computer function properly.</strong></p1>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://wiki.laptop.org/images/thumb/8/89/XO_Annotated_Motherboard.png/800px-XO_Annotated_Motherboard.png" alt="The Motherboard"></div> 
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana">CPU</h2>
    <p1 style="font-family:verdana"><strong>CPU, central processing unit, is the most important part in almost every computer, but why? The CPU is the most important part because it is the part that sends signals to the other parts of the computer, almost like how the brain functions. The CPU is an electronic machine that works on a list of things to do, called 'instructions'.</strong></p1>
   <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.vservercenter.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/a/d/addon_cpu_250.gif" alt="CPU"></div> 
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana">RAM</h2>
    <p1 style="font-family:verdana"><strong>What is RAM? Well first off RAM stands for, Random Access Memory. RAM or random access memory, is for you being able to access any memory cell directly if you know the row and column that intersect at that cell.</strong></p1>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://bim9.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/RAM_SM.png" alt="RAM" style="width:400px;height:420px;"></div> 
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Hard Drive</h2>
    <p1 style="font-family:verdana"><strong>A hard drive is in every technology, and you should know what it's responsiblity is. If you don't then the responsibility of the hard drive is storage. Every thing you have in computer is kept in the hard drive, but not just pictures, music, or documents kept inside, the hard drive keeps your programs, your prefences and even your operating systems. These items and more are all kept in your hard drive.</strong></p1>
     <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://oakdome.com/k5/tutorials/clone-with-usb-drive/images/usb-hard-drive.png" alt="Hard Drive" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></div>
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana">How do the different components communicate with one another?</h2>
    <p1 style="font-family:verdana"><strong>Now, the question is, how do the different components communicate with one another? Well from reading all the description of the other hardware, you will easily see the answer. It is the motherboard. The motherboard is where it receives all the signals then sends it to the part the signal is try to reach. However, where do the signals come from? Again, you may have read it before, and it is from the CPU, this device sends all the signals to the motherboard and the motherboard sends it to teh part the signals are trying to go. That is how all the parts communicate, in order to have a computer that functions properly.</strong></p1>
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana"><strong>What are the keyboard, mouse, and monitor and what do they do?</strong></h2>
    <p1 style="font-family:verdana"><strong>For those who use computers, all know what keyboards, mouse and monitor is and what they do. For those who don't know what they do, a keyboards is what the user uses to type in a computer like how you found this website by using the search bar. A mouse is what the user uses to move an indictator around the computer and able to click on what you want to go like what you use to click to go to this website being able to scroll down. Then, the monitor the screen of the computer, like how you are seeing this screen, and seeing the website. </strong></p1>
